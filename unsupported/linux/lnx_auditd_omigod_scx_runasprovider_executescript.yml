title: OMIGOD SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript
id: 865c10a6-9541-4d11-9f45-9a3484e23b0a
description: Rule to detect the use of the SCX RunAsProvider ExecuteScript to execute any UNIX/Linux script using the /bin/sh shell. Script being executed gets created as a temp file in /tmp folder with a scx* prefix. Then it is invoked from the following directory /etc/opt/microsoft/scx/conf/tmpdir/. The file in that directory has the same prefix scx*. SCXcore, started as the Microsoft Operations Manager UNIX/Linux Agent, is now used in a host of products including Microsoft Operations Manager. Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Operations Management Suite.
