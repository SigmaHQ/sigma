title: Exploitation Activity of CVE-2025-59287 - WSUS Suspicious Child Process
id: 43259cc4-1b80-4931-bd98-baea01afc196
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the creation of command-line interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) as child processes of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) related process wsusservice.exe.
    This behavior is a key indicator of exploitation for the critical remote code execution vulnerability such as CVE-2025-59287, where attackers spawn shells to conduct reconnaissance and further post-exploitation activities.
