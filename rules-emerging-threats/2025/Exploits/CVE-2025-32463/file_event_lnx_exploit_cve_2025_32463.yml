title: Non-Standard Nsswitch.Conf Creation - Potential CVE-2025-32463 Exploitation
id: 10ac0730-c24e-4f4c-81f8-b13a1ac95a1d
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the creation of nsswitch.conf files in non-standard directories, which may indicate exploitation of CVE-2025-32463.
    This vulnerability requires an attacker to create a nsswitch.conf in a directory that will be used during sudo chroot operations.
    When sudo executes, it loads malicious shared libraries from user-controlled locations within the chroot environment,
    potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation.
