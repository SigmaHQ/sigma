status: test
description: |
    Detects potential exploitation attempts of CVE-2022-29072, a 7-Zip privilege escalation and command execution vulnerability.
    7-Zip version 21.07 and earlier on Windows allows privilege escalation (CVE-2022-29072) and command execution when a file with the .7z extension is dragged to the Help>Contents area. This is caused by misconfiguration of 7z.dll and a heap overflow.
    The command runs in a child process under the 7zFM.exe process.
