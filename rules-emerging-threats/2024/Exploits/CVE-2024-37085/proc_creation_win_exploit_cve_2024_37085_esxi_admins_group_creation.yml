title: Potential Exploitation of CVE-2024-37085 - Suspicious Creation Of ESX Admins Group
id: c408acfe-2870-41df-8d2f-9f4daa4555ed
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects execution of the "net.exe" command in order to add a group named "ESX Admins".
    This could indicates a potential exploitation attempt of CVE-2024-37085, which allows an attacker to elevate their privileges to full administrative access on an domain-joined ESXi hypervisor.
    VMware ESXi hypervisors joined to an Active Directory domain consider any member of a domain group named "ESX Admins" to have full administrative access by default.
