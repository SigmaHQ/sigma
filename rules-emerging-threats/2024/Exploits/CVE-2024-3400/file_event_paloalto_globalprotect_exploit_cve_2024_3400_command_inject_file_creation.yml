title: Potential CVE-2024-3400 Exploitation - Palo Alto GlobalProtect OS Command Injection - File Creation
id: bcd95697-e3e7-4c6f-8584-8e3503e6929f
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects suspicious file creations in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS' parent telemetry folder, which are processed by the vulnerable 'dt_curl' script if device telemetry is enabled.
    As said script overrides the shell-subprocess restriction, arbitrary command execution may occur by carefully crafting filenames that are escaped through this function.
