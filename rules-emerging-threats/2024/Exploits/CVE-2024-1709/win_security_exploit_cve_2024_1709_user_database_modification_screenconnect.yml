    This detects file modifications to the temporary xml user database file indicating local user modification in the ScreenConnect server.
    This will occur during exploitation of the ScreenConnect Authentication Bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-1709) in versions <23.9.8, but may also be observed when making legitimate modifications to local users or permissions.
    This requires an Advanced Auditing policy to log a successful Windows Event ID 4663 events and with a SACL set on the directory.
