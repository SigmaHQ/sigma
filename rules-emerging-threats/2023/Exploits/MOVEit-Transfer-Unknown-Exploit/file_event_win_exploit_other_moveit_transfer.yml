id: c3b2a774-3152-4989-83c1-7afc48fd1599
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the creation of files with unexpected extensions in the web root folder of the MOVEit Transfer service.
    Reports mentioned uncommon file types in the "wwwroot" folder as a sign of potential compromise. Attackers used that folder as a staging directory for the exfiltration.
