title: Python WebServer Execution - Linux
id: 3f0f5957-04f8-4792-ad89-192b0303bde6
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the execution of Python web servers via command line interface (CLI).
    After gaining access to target systems, adversaries may use Python's built-in HTTP server modules to quickly establish a web server without requiring additional software.
    This technique is commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios as it provides a simple method for transferring files between the compromised host and attacker-controlled systems.
