title: Potential Abuse of Linux Magic System Request Key
id: ea61bb82-a5e0-42e6-8537-91d29500f1b9
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the potential abuse of the Linux Magic SysRq (System Request) key by adversaries with root or sufficient privileges
    to silently manipulate or destabilize a system. By writing to /proc/sysrq-trigger, they can crash the system, kill processes,
    or disrupt forensic analysisâ€”all while bypassing standard logging. Though intended for recovery and debugging, SysRq can be
    misused as a stealthy post-exploitation tool. It is controlled via /proc/sys/kernel/sysrq or permanently through /etc/sysctl.conf.
