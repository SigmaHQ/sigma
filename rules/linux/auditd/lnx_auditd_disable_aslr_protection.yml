title: ASLR Disabled Via Sysctl or Direct Syscall - Linux
id: e497a24e-9345-4a62-9803-b06d7d7cb132
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects actions that disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) in Linux, including:
      - Use of the `personality` syscall with the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE flag (0x0040000)
      - Modification of the /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space file
      - Execution of the `sysctl` command to set `kernel.randomize_va_space=0`
    Disabling ASLR is often used by attackers during exploit development or to bypass memory protection mechanisms.
    A successful use of these methods can reduce the effectiveness of ASLR and make memory corruption attacks more reliable.
