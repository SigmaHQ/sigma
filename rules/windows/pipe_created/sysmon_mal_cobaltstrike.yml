   definition: 'Note that you have to configure logging for Named Pipe Events in Sysmon config (Event ID 17 and Event ID 18). In the current popular sysmon configuration (https://github.com/SwiftOnSecurity/sysmon-config) this is not there, you have to add it yourself or use this extended version that logs the Named Pipes used in this Sigma repo (https://github.com/Neo23x0/sysmon-config)'
