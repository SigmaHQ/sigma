title: New Firewall Rule Added In Windows Firewall Exception List Via WmiPrvSE.EXE
id: eca81e8d-09e1-4d04-8614-c91f44fd0519
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects the addition of a new "Allow" firewall rule by the WMI process (WmiPrvSE.EXE).
    This can occur if an attacker leverages PowerShell cmdlets such as "New-NetFirewallRule", or directly uses WMI CIM classes such as "MSFT_NetFirewallRule".
