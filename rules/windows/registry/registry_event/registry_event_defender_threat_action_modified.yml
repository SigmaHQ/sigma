description: |
    Detects modifications or creations of Windows Defender's default threat action settings based on severity to 'allow' or take 'no action'.
    This is a highly suspicious configuration change that effectively disables Defender's ability to automatically mitigate threats of a certain severity level,
    allowing malicious software to run unimpeded. An attacker might use this technique to bypass defenses before executing payloads.
