id: 09af397b-c5eb-4811-b2bb-08b3de464ebf
status: experimental
description: |
  An adversary might use WMI to check if a certain Remote Service is running on a remote device.
  When the test completes, a service information will be displayed on the screen if it exists.
  A common feedback message is that "No instance(s) Available" if the service queried is not running.
  A common error message is "Node - (provided IP or default) ERROR Description =The RPC server is unavailable" if the provided remote host is unreacheable
