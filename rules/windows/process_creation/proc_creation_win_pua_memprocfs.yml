title: PUA - MemProcFS Execution for Credential Access
id: 8a1b2c3d-4e5f-6789-abcd-ef1234567890
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects execution of MemProcFS, a memory forensics tool that can be misused by attackers for credential access.
    MemProcFS mounts physical memory as a virtual file system, allowing direct access to process memory and system structures.
    Threat actors may abuse this tool to dump memory contents from processes like LSASS or extract registry hives to obtain credentials, LSA secrets, SAM data, and cached domain credentials.
    MemProcFS usage that is not part of authorized forensic analysis should be treated as suspicious and warrants further investigation.
