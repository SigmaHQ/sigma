id: 8e95e73e-ba02-4a87-b4d7-0929b8053038
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects script interpreters, command-line tools, and similar suspicious child processes of ArcSOC.exe.
    ArcSOC.exe is the process name which hosts ArcGIS Server REST services. If an attacker compromises an ArcGIS
    Server system and uploads a malicious Server Object Extension (SOE), they can send crafted requests to the corresponding
    service endpoint and remotely execute code from the ArcSOC.exe process.
