title: Forfiles Command Execution
id: 9aa5106d-bce3-4b13-86df-3a20f1d5cf0b
status: test
description: |
    Detects the execution of "forfiles" with the "/c" flag.
    While this is an expected behavior of the tool, it can be abused in order to proxy execution through it with any binary.
    Can be used to bypass application whitelisting.
