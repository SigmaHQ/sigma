title: System Information Discovery with WMIC
id: 9d5a1274-922a-49d0-87f3-8c653483b909
status: experimental
description: Detect use of the WMI command-line (WMIC) utility to identify and display various system information, including OS, CPU, GPU, and disk drive names; memory capacity; display resolution; and baseboard, BIOS, and GPU driver products/versions. Some of these commands were used by Aurora Stealer in late 2022/early 2023.
