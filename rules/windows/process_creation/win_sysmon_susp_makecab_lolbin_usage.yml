title: Suspicious Makecab Usage Against Known LOLBins
id: 14fdd486-8a7d-4772-a0b2-be7335f3c008
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects usage of makecab.exe to compress known LOLBins (regsvr32, rundll32, mshta, certreq).
    Attackers often use this technique for staging and defense evasion.
    This rule specifically looks for makecab.exe referencing these binaries in its command line,
    which is typically uncommon in normal environments.
