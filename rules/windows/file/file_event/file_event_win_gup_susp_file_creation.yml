title: Notepad++ Updater Creates Suspicious File
id: 3b8f4c92-6a51-4d7e-9c3a-8e2d1f5a7b09
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects when the Notepad++ updater (gup.exe) creates files in suspicious locations or with suspicious extensions.
    This may indicate a supply chain attack where the notepad++ update mechanism has been hijacked to deliver malicious payloads.
    In late 2025, it was discovered that WinGUp (the Notepad++ updater) traffic could be hijacked and redirected to malicious servers, allowing attackers to deliver and execute arbitrary binaries on target systems.
    This is due to a weakness in the updater's validation of update file integrity and authenticity which was fixed in later versions of Notepad++ after v8.8.9.
    Attackers able to intercept updater traffic could exploit this to execute unwanted binaries or malware on target systems.
