id: 402b955c-8fe0-4a8c-b635-622b4ac5f902
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects creation of a container with a hostPath mount.
    A hostPath volume mounts a directory or a file from the node to the container.
    Attackers who have permissions to create a new pod in the cluster may create one with a writable hostPath volume and chroot to escape to the underlying node.
