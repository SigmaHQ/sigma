title: RBAC Permission Enumeration Attempt
id: 84b777bd-c946-4d17-aa2e-c39f5a454325
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects identities attempting to enumerate their Kubernetes RBAC permissions.
    In the early stages of a breach, attackers will aim to list the permissions they have within the compromised environment.
    In a Kubernetes cluster, this can be achieved by interacting with the API server, and querying the SelfSubjectAccessReview API via e.g. a "kubectl auth can-i --list" command.
    This will enumerate the Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) rules defining the compromised user's authorization.
