title: Potential Sidecar Injection Into Running Deployment
id: ad9012a6-e518-4432-9890-f3b82b8fc71f
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects attempts to inject a sidecar container into a running deployment.
    A sidecar container is an additional container within a pod, that resides alongside the main container.
    One way to add containers to running resources like Deployments/DeamonSets/StatefulSets, is via a "kubectl patch" operation.
    By injecting a new container within a legitimate pod, an attacker can run their code and hide their activity, instead of running their own separated pod in the cluster.
