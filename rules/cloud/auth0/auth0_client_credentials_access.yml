title: High Risk Event - Risk of Copying Client Credentials
id: 45f22e95-1d6a-496a-b0f8-0f5d33f15c72
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects potential risks of copying client credentials by monitoring if a client is read via the Dashboard or Management API.
    This can indicate that someone is trying to copy client credentials for malicious purposes.

explanation: |
    This detection monitors when client settings are accessed via the Auth0 Management API.
    Specifically, it filters on events where the `client_secret` is included in the response,
    and the targeted `client_id` is among a list of known critical applications.
    This may indicate credential harvesting or administrative misuse.

    Splunk Query:
    index=auth0 data.tenant_name="{your-tenant-name}"
    data.type="mgmt_api_read" data.description="Get client by ID"
    data.details.accessedSecrets{}=client_secret
    data.details.response.body.client_id IN ("critical-client_id-1", "critical-client_id-etc")
    | table data.details.response.body.client_id, data.user_id, data.ip

    Tenant Logs Query:
    type: "mgmt_api_read" AND description: "Get client by ID"
comments:
    - Tune the list of monitored client_ids to cover only high-risk or externally-facing applications.
    - This query should be scoped to specific tenants via the `tenant_name` field.
    - This detection assumes you rely on shared client secrets (confidential clients); mobile/SPAs may be excluded.
    - Ensure that alerting thresholds are adjusted for authorized but rare access patterns.
    - Prevention - Consider rotating client_secret values regularly and migrating to private_key_jwt when possible.
    - Prevention - Limit number of tenant admins and users with the "Editor - Specific App" or "Viewer - Config Settings" roles.
    - Prevention - Rotate credentials on a schedule or after exposure.
    - Prevention - Enforce stronger auth schemes such as private_key_jwt instead of client_secret.
