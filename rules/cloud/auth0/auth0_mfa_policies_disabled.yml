explanation: |
    The query filters for modifications of MFA settings by checking if any policies are enabled either as Always ('all-applications') or When Risky ('confidence-score').
    It returns records when the response body is empty meaning that no policies are enabled, i.e. Never.
    The splunk query below returns only the latest policy modification record.
    If MFA is set to Never, this query returns one record.
    If MFA is set in Always or Use Adaptive MFA, no record is returned.
    The splunk query displays the modifying IP and user.

    Splunk Query:
    index=auth0 data.tenant_name="{your-tenant-name}"
    data.type="sapi" data.description="Update multi-factor authentication policies"
    | sort - _time
    | head 1
    | rename data.details.response.body{} as mfa_mode
    | where NOT match(mfa_mode, "^(all-applications|confidence-score)$")
    |table _time, data.details.request.ip, data.user_id, data.details.request.body{}

    Tenant Logs Query:
    type: "sapi" AND description: "Update multi-factor authentication policies"
comments:
    - The splunk query above shall be tuned to reflect a valid tenant name.
    - A possible false positive is when MFA policies are applied through Actions.
    - Limit the detection to actions conducted from not allowlisted IPs and/or particular users.
    - Prevention - Control tenant admins, i.e. "Admin", as this role has permissions to modify any application.
    - Prevention - Enforce MFA for tenant admins to reduce the risk of an adversary gaining access.
    - Prevention - Control Management API scopes that allow modification of attack protection features - update:attack_protection.
    - Prevention - Control usage of Management API from only trusted IPs by applying Network ACL scoped to "management".
