falsepositives:
    - Kubernetes cluster being created or  deleted may be performed by a system administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.
    - Kubernetes cluster created or deleted from unfamiliar users should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
