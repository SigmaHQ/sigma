title: AWS EnableRegion Command Monitoring
id: a5ffb6ea-c784-4e01-b30a-deb6e58ca2ab
status: experimental
description: |
    AWS has 30+ regions, some of them are enabled by default, others must be explicitly enabled in each account separately. 
    There may be situations where security monitoring does not cover some new AWS regions.
    With this alert, we are trying to track the creation of a new region to verify that this innovation is reasonable and our instincts support it.
