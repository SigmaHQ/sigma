falsepositives:
    - AssumeRole may be done by a system or network administrator. Verify whether the user identity, user agent, and/or hostname should be making changes in your environment.
    - AssumeRole from unfamiliar users or hosts should be investigated. If known behavior is causing false positives, it can be exempted from the rule.
    - Automated processes that uses Terraform may lead to false positives.
