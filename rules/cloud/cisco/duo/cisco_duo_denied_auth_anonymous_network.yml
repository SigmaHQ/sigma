title: Duo Authentication from Anonymous Network (Tor/VPN) Blocked
id: d8d5614d-bde8-4c5f-a9aa-b8e5af97f7b0
status: experimental
description: |
    Flags authentication attempts that Duo **blocked due to use of an anonymous network** (such as Tor exit node or known anonymizing proxy/VPN). Duo policies can deny access from anonymized IP addresses. In the authentication log, this appears as result `"DENY"` or `"FAILURE"` with reason `"anonymous_ip"`. Such events mean an attempted login came from an IP associated with anonymity services and was refused by policy. This often suggests malicious activity â€” for example, an attacker trying to hide their origin. Any `"anonymous_ip"` denial should be investigated to identify the source and intent.
