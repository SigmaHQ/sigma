We invite you to collaborate, exchange thoughts or information, and engage with one another.

## Enforcement & Consequences

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Community Manager. Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated by community members, maintainers, and SigmaHQ team members.  The SigmaHQ Community Manager and maintainers will review and investigate all complaints.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an Sigma community member anyone contributing to our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) engages in unacceptable behavior, the Community Manager may take any temporary or permanent action they deem appropriate, up to and including immediate expulsion from the Sigma community without warning.

Sigma maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Manager’s & Maintainers’ Responsibilities

Sigma Community Managers are responsible for upholding the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Sigma Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or that they otherwise deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
