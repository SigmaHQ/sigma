Welcome to the Sigma main rule repository. The place where detection engineers, threat hunters and all defensive security practitioners collaborate on detection rules. The repository offers more than 3000 detection rules of different type and aims to make reliable detections accessible to all at no cost.

Currently the repository offers three types of rules:

* [Generic Detection Rules](./rules/) - Are threat agnostic, their aim is to detect a behavior or an implementation of a technique or procedure that was, can or will be used by a potential threat actor.
* [Threat Hunting Rules](./rules-threat-hunting/) - Are broader in scope and are meant to give the analyst a starting point to hunt for potential suspicious or malicious activity
* [Emerging Threat Rules](./rules-emerging-threats/) - Are rules that cover specific threats, that are timely and relevant for certain periods of time. These threats include specific APT campaigns, exploitation of Zero-Day vulnerabilities, specific malware used during an attack,...etc.

### What is Sigma

Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file.

The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

Sigma is for log files what [Snort](https://www.snort.org/) is for network traffic and [YARA](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) is for files.

### Why Sigma

Today, everyone collects log data for analysis. People start working on their own, processing numerous white papers, blog posts and log analysis guidelines, extracting the necessary information and build their own searches and dashboard. Some of their searches and correlations are great and very useful but they lack a standardized format in which they can share their work with others.

Others provide excellent analyses, include IOCs and YARA rules to detect the malicious files and network connections, but have no way to describe a specific or generic detection method in log events. Sigma is meant to be an open standard in which such detection mechanisms can be defined, shared and collected in order to improve the detection capabilities for everyone.

### üåü Key Features

* A continuously growing list of detection and hunting rules, peer reviewed by a community of professional Detection Engineers.
* Vendor agnostic detection rules.
* Easily shareable across communities and reports
