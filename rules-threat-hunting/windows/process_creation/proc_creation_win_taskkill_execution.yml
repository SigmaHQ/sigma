title: Process Terminated Via Taskkill
id: 86085955-ea48-42a2-9dd3-85d4c36b167d
status: test
description: |
    Detects execution of "taskkill.exe" in order to stop a service or a process. Look for suspicious parents executing this command in order to hunt for potential malicious activity.
    Attackers might leverage this in order to conduct data destruction or data encrypted for impact on the data stores of services like Exchange and SQL Server.
