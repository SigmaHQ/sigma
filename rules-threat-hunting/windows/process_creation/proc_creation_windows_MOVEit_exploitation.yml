title: MOVEit exploitation
id: 39ac1fb0-07f1-474b-b97e-c5c0eace0d79
hypothesis: MOVEit affected hosts execute csc.exe via w3wp.exe process to dynamically compile malicious DLL file.
description: >
    MOVEit is affected by a critical vulnerability. Exploited hosts show evidence of dynamically compliling a DLL and writing it under 
    C:\\Windows\\Microsoft\.NET\\Framework64\\v4\.0\.30319\\Temporary ASP\.NET Files\\root\\([a-z0-9]{5,12})\\([a-z0-9]{5,12})\\App_Web_[a-z0-9]{5,12}\.dll.
    
    Hunting Opportunity
    ---
    
    Events from IIS dynamically compiling binaries via the csc.exe on behalf of the MOVEit application, especially since May 27th should be investigated.
