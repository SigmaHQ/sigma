title: Ping Delay via CMD Followed by File Deletion
id: 6c32f124-9a02-4749-87ab-0b2d4fe27cb2
status: experimental
description: |
    Detects a ping delay to 127.0.0.7 via cmd.exe observed with Mamona ransomeware.
    The use of 127.0.0.7 instead of the more common 127.0.0.1 helps it bypass detection rules that specifically look for the default loopback address.
    The command also issues the command below to delay execution for three seconds and then deletes itself from disk.
