title: Suspicious Creation TXT File in User Desktop
id: caf02a0a-1e1c-4552-9b48-5e070bd88d11
status: test
description: |
    Detects creation of .txt files in user desktop folders via cmd.exe. This behavior may indicate ransomware deploying ransom notes, but can also occur during legitimate administrative tasks.
    Analysts should investigate for suspicious filenames (e.g., "RANSOM", "DECRYPT", "READ_ME"), bulk file creation patterns, or concurrent encryption activity to determine if this is part of a ransomware attack.
