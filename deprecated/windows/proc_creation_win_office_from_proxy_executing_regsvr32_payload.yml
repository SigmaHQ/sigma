title: Excel Proxy Executing Regsvr32 With Payload
id: 9d1c72f5-43f0-4da5-9320-648cf2099dd0
status: deprecated
description: |
  Excel called wmic to finally proxy execute regsvr32 with the payload.
  An attacker wanted to break suspicious parent-child chain (Office app spawns LOLBin).
  But we have command-line in the event which allow us to "restore" this suspicious parent-child chain and detect it.
  Monitor process creation with "wmic process call create" and LOLBins in command-line with parent Office application processes.
